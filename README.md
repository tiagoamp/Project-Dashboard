# Project-Dashboard
Dashboard generator based in 'xml' and 'trello-json' input files.

It is based in xml/json templates, from where this program generates an html page with charts, backlog, kanban and other project informations.

It was developed to be a more convenient way for stakeholders to view the project progress.

Although it was made for a specific projects I'm working on, I've tried to make it as generic as possible.

It's always a unfinished work, there is always something more to show (better) in the dashboard!
Feel free to colaborate!  :-)

Oh.. and there is a big To Do List of features for this too!
